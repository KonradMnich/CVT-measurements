# Choice of veolocity sensor
In our experiment we are able to read velocity from three different sensors:
* Servo-drive encoder
* Shaft encoder
* and Linear potentiometer\
The first one is the most accurate, the last one the easiest to read.
In this folder I check what is the trade-off concerning the quality of data.
In the first place I cure the data and prepare it for analysis.
In the next step I compare the data and conclude on which sensor should be used.
